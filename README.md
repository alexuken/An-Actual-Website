There isn't much to this page because this was solely created based on the fact this is the current game I'm grinding/interested in. I'm AR 35 (Adventurer Rank 35) at the moment which I believe is quite decent for a free-to-play player. I'm quite hooked because this game offers more than what comes to eye, it's not like your typical role-playing game where you just follow along the story line and end up endlessly grinding, there's a lot of puzzles & riddles and exploration on your own that needs to be done to enhance the user experience.
